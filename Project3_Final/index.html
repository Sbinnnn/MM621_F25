        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>
          When the user clicks anywhere on the screen, a bowl appears on the water.
          The bowls float and bounce like light balls, and they create different sounds
          when they gently hit each other. With water-like shadows and a background image,
          the interface expresses the idea of “small sound objects drifting on the water.”
        </p>

        <h3>1. Interaction Flow</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The user clicks anywhere on the screen.</li>
          <li>A bowl appears at the clicked position.</li>
          <li>The bowl floats and bounces lightly on the water (no gravity).</li>
          <li>A random sound plays each time two bowls collide.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>2. Visual Concept</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Background Image</strong>: A full-screen image that looks like still water
            or a tank is used as the background.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bowl Images</strong>: Six different bowl images are randomly selected
            to create a different visual composition each time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Blue Ellipse Shadow</strong>: A soft blue ellipse is drawn under each bowl
            to give the feeling that it is slightly floating on the water
            (not affecting physics).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>3. Sound Concept</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Prepare eight different sound clips.</li>
          <li>
            When a collision happens between bowls, one sound is randomly chosen
            from the array and played.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a sound is already playing, it does not overlap too much,
            preventing excessive noise.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h3>4. Where the Inspiration Came From</h3>
        <p>
          Floating Bowls began with a simple question:
          “Can we create a moment of pause and calm even in a digital space?”
          Instead of a complex UI or task-oriented interaction,
          I believed that slow movement and soft sound alone
          can bring the user into a <strong>meditative state</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The slow and gentle movement of objects floating on water</li>
          <li>The light rhythm created when they softly touch each other</li>
          <li>The small sense of chance that comes from unexpected patterns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Together, these elements guide the user toward an interaction
          that feels more like <strong>observing</strong> than controlling.
          I see this as an experimental interface that can offer
          small moments of rest and sensory focus within a digital experience.
