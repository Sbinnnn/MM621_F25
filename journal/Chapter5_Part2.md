# Chapter5_Part2
This chapter explains how negative our society’s attitude toward error is. No human or any living being is perfect. Because of many internal and external factors, we can make mistakes at any time. However, society has spent centuries blaming individuals and hiding errors instead of learning from them. But what would happen if we openly acknowledged errors? Are errors always negative? I don’t think so. If we recognize and record them, we can actually improve systems. The real problem is that society often refuses to accept this. The examples of Toyota’s error-handling process and NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System show how a reporting culture based on learning rather than punishment can significantly increase safety. The idea that pilots can report their own mistakes without being punished reduces fear and encourages system-level improvement, which I found to be a very thoughtful design approach.

I also liked the Poka-yoke key example. When I moved from Korea to the United States, I started using physical keys for the first time in more than twenty years. Even after living here for a year, I still cannot remember which direction to turn the key. My husband keeps telling me to understand how the lock mechanism works, but honestly, I do not want to rely on memory. Instead, I should try using a small signifier, just like Poka-yoke suggests, such as putting a sticker next to the keyhole so I do not turn it the wrong way. This small constraint can prevent errors before they happen. It shows how a simple physical sign can reduce many mistakes, and I believe similar designs should be used more often in real products and services.

Lastly, the paradox of automation made a strong impression on me. Automation has transformed modern industries, and in normal situations it is often safer and more accurate than humans. But when automation fails, humans usually notice the failure too late to respond properly. That is why people still hesitate to fully trust self-driving cars or automated medical devices. Even though Tesla promotes autonomous driving, I personally do not trust it completely. So if full automation is not the answer, what is?
