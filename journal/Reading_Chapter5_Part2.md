# The Design of Everyday Things — Chapter 5 Part 2 Personal Response  
Subin Choi

Sometimes in daily life, I wonder why certain products are designed with restrictions when they could be easier to use. For example, when I first tried to open an Advil bottle or a prescription bottle from CVS, it was surprisingly difficult. Later, I learned that it was a child-safety cap, and it made me think about the hidden complexity behind these design constraints. Even though forcing functions can be frustrating, I often forget that they are not created to annoy users—they are meant to prevent mistakes and reduce danger. Interlocks, lock-ins, and lockouts all exist to stop possible accidents before they happen, but people sometimes try to bypass them because they feel inconvenient. This makes me wonder how designers can create safety features that do not feel uncomfortable or restrictive for users.

I also realized the importance of signifiers through an experience in a parking lot. After loading groceries into my car at Target, I pressed the button to close the trunk and turned around to return the shopping cart. Then I heard a warning sound from the car. When I looked back, I saw the trunk opening again. The sound made me notice the problem, and I found that the cart handle was blocking the trunk hook. Without this sound, I might have walked away without knowing the trunk was still open, and someone could have taken my groceries. This moment reminded me how powerful sound can be as a signifier that communicates information we cannot see.

The electric vehicle example also made sense to me. Many times, I didn’t notice an electric car approaching because it was so quiet. If this is a problem even for someone like me with normal hearing, it must be much more dangerous for people with hearing difficulties. After years of trying to make cars quieter, designers now have to add new warning sounds again. This ironic situation shows that design is closely connected to context, society, and ethics.

## Conclusion
Overall, this chapter reminded me that some level of constraint is necessary. Technology does not automatically make life better. Good design requires finding the right balance—removing unnecessary difficulty while keeping the essential constraints that keep people safe.
