# The Design of Everyday Things — Chapter 4 Personal Response  
Subin Choi

---

Good design should be simple and allow users to act on their own.  
However, the idea of “simplicity” is not as easy as it looks.  
Norman explains that designers should not just make things look minimal, but use **affordances** and **constraints** so that people can understand how to use a product without reading a manual.

I was impressed by the idea that design can guide behavior without words.  
The four types of constraints—physical, semantic, cultural, and logical—clearly show how people figure out “what can be done” when they face something new.  
The Lego motorcycle example was especially interesting because it shows how anyone, regardless of age, can assemble it correctly without instructions.  
It made me realize that good design means creating a structure that “explains itself.”

I also agreed with Norman’s point about battery orientation.  
It seems like a small problem, but solving these small frustrations is what user-centered design is about.  
After reading this chapter, I began to notice everyday things—door handles, switches, plugs—and how different constraints work in each of them.  
For example, in my new apartment, there are many different kinds of door handles, and some of them are confusing.  
A door that looks like it should be pushed sometimes has to be pulled instead.  
This small inconsistency creates unnecessary frustration for users.

In the end, I learned that good design does not limit users’ choices, but **prevents mistakes and makes the correct actions visible**.  
As a designer, I want to create experiences that people can understand and use intuitively, without ever needing to read instructions.
