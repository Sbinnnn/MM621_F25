Why do people feel guilty or blame themselves even when dealing with non-living objects? In this chapter, the example of the stuck filing cabinet shows that when a device does not work, people often think it is the problem. If this pattern continues, people will keep blaming themselves for design failures, and this can create bigger issues in the future. Norman argues that most mistakes we experience in everyday interactions are not caused by users but by design. Humans do not behave logically. They act based on the clues available to them and make quick interpretations. For this reason, design should guide users smoothly and help them recover from errors without frustration.

Norman describes two gaps: the Gulf of Execution and the Gulf of Evaluation. I can clearly relate this to the service I am designing for children with disabilities. Users often do not know what they should do, which relates to the Gulf of Execution. They also cannot tell whether their action worked or not, which relates to the Gulf of Evaluation.

If my service lacks clear signifiers and feedback, a child may not understand what a word card is or how to interact with it. They may stop using the service very quickly. In this situation, the problem is not the child. It is the designer who failed to bridge the two gulfs.

Most human behavior is driven by the subconscious mind.
For example, when a new pop-up appears, people often tap a button before consciously reading it. They act based on patterns and expectations instead of careful learning. This means the design should not expect users to figure things out. It should support the natural shortcuts and habits people already have.

One idea that stayed with me is that people always try to explain what is happening. If a system leads the user to the wrong interpretation, the user builds a wrong conceptual model and repeats the wrong actions. This is the designer’s responsibility.

When designing interfaces for children with disabilities or sensory-regulation tools, I cannot explain errors as user traits. When a mistake happens, it signals that something in the design is unclear. I need to ask myself if I am ready to take responsibility as a designer instead of blaming the user.

Children, parents, and teachers often assume they are not good with technology when the system is confusing. Norman gives a clear message:

Humans make mistakes. Design must be strong enough to handle those mistakes.

This idea is especially important in interaction design for education and disability support. Mistakes should be treated as a natural part of learning, not as failure.

Norman explains human processing in three layers: Visceral, Behavioral, and Reflective. Good design must support all three. Even after the interaction ends, people remember the emotional experience and decide whether they want to return. A good product leaves a positive memory and encourages the user to come back.

Why do users fail? Norman gives a clear answer. The design fails first.

Design should help people act, continue acting, and recover from errors smoothly. When I look back at the challenges I faced during user studies with children, many of the difficulties were actually design problems. Now I see failures not as negative results but as important data. They show exactly which parts of the system need to be improved.
