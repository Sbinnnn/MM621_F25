# Chp1 of DUET

## Introduction
The first chapter of this book mainly explains the idea of **visibility**. Norman shows why visibility is important in design by using different topics and examples. Among them, I found **mapping (p.23)** and **feedback (p.27)** the most interesting and easy to relate to.  

## Mapping (p.23)
When reading about mapping, I thought about bad and good examples. A bad example is the light switches in a hotel room. There are many lights, but the switches do not show which light they control. As a result, I always had to turn them all on and off to find out. The switches were not mapped clearly, and this made my experience uncomfortable.  

A good example, in contrast, is the gas stove. On the stove, the knobs show which burner they control, so I can easily turn on the correct one. These two cases show how much mapping can change the userâ€™s experience, even with the same type of switch.  

## Feedback (p.27)
Feedback was another topic that caught my attention. For example, when I turn the stove knob, I see a flame appear, which tells me that the gas is working. The flame itself is clear feedback.  

On the other hand, I once pressed the elevator button in a tall building, but there was no floor display. I did not know if the elevator was coming or working, so I waited anxiously. This example shows how, without feedback, users feel confused and insecure.  

## Conclusion
From this chapter, I realized that **visibility is simple and basic, but it is also essential in design**. I want to remember this lesson and make sure that the information users need is always visible in my own design work.
